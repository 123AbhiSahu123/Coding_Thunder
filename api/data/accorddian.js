        content: "This is content😎 of Python, Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5, capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing. Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.",

        title: "C/C++",
        content: "This is content🤔 of C/C++, The C and C++ programming languages are closely related but have many significant differences. C++ began as a fork of an early, pre-standardized C, and was designed to be mostly source-and-link compatible with C compilers of the time. Due to this, development tools for the two languages (such as IDEs and compilers) are often integrated into a single product, with the programmer able to specify C or C++ as their source language. However, C is not a subset of C++, and nontrivial C programs will not compile as C++ code without modification. Likewise, C++ introduces many features that are not available in C and in practice almost all code written in C++ is not conforming C code. This article, however, focuses on differences that cause conforming C code to be ill-formed C++ code, or to be conforming/well-formed in both languages but to behave differently in C and C++.",

        content: "This is content💖 of Java, Java was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun's Java platform. Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.",

        content: "This is content😊 of DotNet, In the late 1990s, Microsoft began developing a managed code runtime and programming language (C#) which it billed together as part of the '.NET platform', with the core runtime and software libraries comprising the .NET Framework. The .NET platform (pronounced as 'dot net'; formerly named .NET Core) is a free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. It is a cross-platform successor to the .NET Framework. The project is mainly developed by Microsoft employees by way of the .NET Foundation and is today released under an MIT License. New versions of the .NET platform are released annually, typically in November. The most recent version of .NET is .NET 10, released in November 2025, which is a long-term support (LTS) version, and is scheduled to receive updates until November 2028.",
